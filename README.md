## Getting Started
Visual Studio 2017/2019 or CLion 2019/2020 is recommended, navia is officially untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:

Make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!
